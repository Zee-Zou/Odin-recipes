    <h2>Mint Chicken Recipe</h2>
    <p>If you've never tried rhubarb before, this is the recipe for you. The sweet, crisp topping taking the edge off the tart, tangy fruit, both benefiting from a creamy scoop of vanilla ice cream.</p>
    <p>This is a great, old-fashioned American dessert. You can substitute all-purpose flour for the whole wheat flour.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>½ cup margarine</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.</li>
        <li>Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough.</li>
    </ol>
