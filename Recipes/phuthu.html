    <p>Krummelpap, a variation of mieliepap, is an old-time South African favorite, probably eaten by all of the different race groups.</p>
    <p>This krummelpap recipe was sent to us by John Herber. He was taught this method as a kid by Johanna Sithole, a Zulu lady whom he holds in very high esteem.</p>
